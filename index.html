        <h1>Desiree Nkodia</h1>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>As a highly motivated software developer, I am passionate about cloud technologies, particularly Azure. With a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and a wealth of experience in Agile development methodologies, I have an impressive track record of delivering high-quality, robust software solutions using programming languages such as C# and JavaScript. My expertise lies in developing scalable, reliable back-end systems, but I am equally comfortable working on user-facing components. I have a keen desire to learn and adapt to new technologies and programming languages, making me a versatile and valuable member of any team. I excel in problem-solving and have a proven track record of meeting project deadlines</p>
